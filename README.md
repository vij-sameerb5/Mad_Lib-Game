## 🎯 What It Does

- Takes a **Wikipedia article URL**

- Replaces **adjectives and verbs** with Mad Lib-style blanks
- Lets you fill in funny words using **interactive input widgets**
- Or leave them blank and it fills them with **random hilarious defaults** (like `yeeted`, `greasy`, `teleported`, etc.)
- Generates a **personalized, absurd version** of a real Wikipedia article
