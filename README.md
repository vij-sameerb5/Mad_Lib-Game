# 🤪 Funny Mad Libs Generator (Adjective + Verb Edition)

Welcome to the most chaotic and entertaining way to learn Natural Language Processing: **Funny Mad Libs powered by spaCy + ipywidgets in Google Colab**!

This project was originally created during the **DC Python Dojo** event hosted by **Rami** and **Jeff** near **George Washington University (GWU)** 🎉 — major thanks to them for the fun challenge!

## 🎯 What It Does

- Takes a **Wikipedia article URL**
- Extracts the **first paragraph** using `BeautifulSoup`
- Uses **spaCy NLP** to tag parts of speech
- Replaces **adjectives and verbs** with Mad Lib-style blanks
- Lets you fill in funny words using **interactive input widgets**
- Or leave them blank and it fills them with **random hilarious defaults** (like `yeeted`, `greasy`, `teleported`, etc.)
- Generates a **personalized, absurd version** of a real Wikipedia article
